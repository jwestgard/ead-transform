< <p>William Preston's law practice required him to travel frequently to Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and New York.  The Prestons maintained a residence and law office in Baltimore and a farm, Pleasant Plains, near Towson, Maryland, in Baltimore County.  Among their family friends were the philanthropist Johns Hopkins and A.S. Abell, founder of the <emph render="italic">Baltimore Sun</emph>.  Active in the politics of his day, William Preston ran for Congress in 1859.  Shortly before the 1859 election, Preston was attacked and hit over the head, possibly by the Baltimore street gang, the Plug Uglies.  He was seriously injured and for the rest of his life may have suffered physical and mental difficulties as a result.  The incident is remembered in a line from the song "Plug Uglies!!":  "There's their Billy Preston, they beat him out of sight."  The injury may have precipitated his spousal abuse of Madge Preston and also the initiation of her diary writing in 1860.  In her diaries, Madge wrote of a personality change that is displayed in his angry outbursts towards her. William was also an ardent supporter of Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy.  In 1863 he visited Gettysburg shortly after the battle and described the scene in detail to his wife.  The Prestons expressed strong Confederate sentiments throughout their diaries and correspondence.</p>

< <p>Among the many topics covered in the letters between the family members are the news of the day, the ever-present weather conditions, visits to and from friends, illness (all three suffered from frequent headaches), the sewing of clothes by hand and on a sewing machine by Madge for May and the grandchildren, gifts purchased and received, chess and backgammon games played and won or lost, and problems related to the Pleasant Plains management and their Baltimore residence. Madge wrote weekly to May while she attended St. Joseph's; these letters report family news of the day and occasionally political events.  In a letter to May dated October 30, 1862, she wrote about "the drafting." and "upholding the tyranny of the present government."  On November 29, 1862, her letter mentioned the release of "respected but unfortunate 'fellow citizens'" Baltimore Mayor George Brown and Marshall Kane from prison for their participation in the Baltimore Riot of 1861.</p>

< <scopecontent><p>This series relates to the law practice of William P. Preston, including correspondence to and from him regarding the various clients he represented. Included are letters from his clients explaining the circumstances that required legal advice. In one 1870 letter, Preston received an anonymous account of the life and work of Father James Dolan of Baltimore.  The account begins in 1847 with the arrival of Irish emigrants to Baltimore and their "destitute condition" which aroused Father Dolan and members of the Hibernian Society, a charitable organization for Irish emigrants in the state of Maryland,  to provide assistance to them and continues with entries from Father Dolans diary describing work among the Baltimore poor. The series is arranged alphabetically by recipient.</p></scopecontent>

< <p>For the first six months of 1887, Carita Mason (also known as Googy) received many letters from her uncle by marriage, John Bullis.  Bullis was a widow. His wife, Alice, the sister of Caritas mother, Carolina Rodriguez Mason, died in late 1886. Prior to her death, Alice wrote to Googy on July 12, 1886, that she was <emph render="italic">"very nervous and not feeling well"</emph> and would not visit her husband at Fort Sill. Following her death and in the spring of 1887, Bullis decided to travel from his post at Fort Sill to visit friends and relatives in the northeastern United States, including the Masons in Virginia. All of his letters to Carita show an increasing affection for her and disappointment that her mother does not like him. On April 28th, 1887 he wrote: <emph render="italic">"I told you in the winter if you continued to do so (write me such nice letters), I should fall in love with you or words to that effect".</emph> After visiting with Carita and her family in late May or early June, he wrote her from Washington, D.C., on June 5th: <emph render="italic">"I regret that your mother should have been so severe toward me".</emph> On June 8, he wrote her from New York City: <emph render="italic">"I think of you often and dislike to go further from you."</emph> On June 15th from Buffalo, NY, he wrote: <emph render="italic">"I wish you could have made the journey with me and met my people but your ma is against me from some cause. She must know that my name and record are good and why she should do so is more than I can understand."</emph> Evidence of his good name and record are found in two letters written to him from his Army friends in 1887. Perhaps the fact that he was not only Caritas uncle but also that he was 26 years her senior, old enough to be her father, was why her mother felt as she did about him. Bullis himself may have realized another reason when he writes on June 18th: <emph render="italic">"more than one half of my life (twenty three years) has been passed in the army and most of that time on the frontier."</emph></p>
< <p>In mid-August, 1887, Carita received a letter of congratulations on her engagement to Thomas Swann. "The Mirror", a Loudon County, VA newspaper, announced the marriage of Carita Mason to Thomas Swann on December 31, 1887. In January 1889, Thomas Swanns aunt Ellen Latrobe, wrote Carita about preparing herself for the baby and in February Fanny Mason sent her "affectionate greeting to the little stranger." By March 11, 1889, Carita was dead at 23 years of age. That same year three letters to Carolina Mason, Caritas mother, express sympathy on the loss of Carita and comfort that she has her grandson, Thomas Swann. Two letters from Tom to his Mamma (grandmother Carolina) tell of his life at St. Pauls School, Concord, NH in 1907 and his arrival at Princeton University in 1909.</p>
< <p>To bring the Bullis/Mason relationship full circle a letter from Josephine Bullis in 1905 to Carolina expressed her concern about Carolinas mothers illness and offered her help if Carolina decided to come to Texas. Mrs. Bullis was John Bullis' second wife.</p>

In January 1889, Thomas Swannâs aunt Ellen Latrobe, wrote Carita about preparing herself for the baby and in February Fanny Mason sent her "affectionate greeting to the little stranger." By March 11, 1889, Carita was dead at 23 years of age. That same year three letters to Carolina Mason, Caritaâs mother, express sympathy on the loss of Carita and comfort that she has her grandson, Thomas Swann. Two letters from Tom to his Mamma (grandmother Carolina) tell of his life at St. Paulâs School, Concord, NH in 1907 and his arrival at Princeton University in 1909.</p>
> <p>To bring the Bullis/Mason relationship full circle a letter from Josephine Bullis in 1905 to Carolina expressed her concern about Carolinaâs motherâs illness and offered her help if Carolina decided to come to Texas. Mrs. Bullis was John Bullis' second wife.</p>

< <p>The original order of the collection was neither always readily apparent nor conducive to easy researcher access so some changes were made during processing and arrangement.  Original folder titles were kept whenever possible, but changes, such as adding full names where the original folder title only indicated a last name or adding a content designator to a folder (e.g. Yamamoto was changed to Yamamoto, Isoroku  Interviews, or Draft was changed to "Tora! Tora! Tora!"  Draft), were made to make titles more descriptive of the folder contents, eliminate ambiguity in names, and facilitate easier access to the collection via the finding aid.  For the sake of consistency in naming conventions across the whole collection, all Japanese and other Asian names are listed in the standard Western style (i.e. Surname, Given Name).  At the series level, there was no consistent original order to the materials, but the series arrangement of the collection reflects groupings in Prange's original order based on major projects on which Prange worked during his career.  For example, the Sorge Series (Series 6) was created by combining two large groupings of research and correspondence regarding the Sorge projects and a few stray folders that were elsewhere in the collection.  Within each series the folders are arranged in alphabetical order for ease of access.</p>

< <p>Prange married Anne Davidson Root in June 1937 and began teaching in the University of Maryland History Department that fall.    After publishing a few articles about German National Socialism (Nazism) and his own experiences in Germany, Prange's first book, <title render="italic">Hitlers Words: Two Decades of National Socialism, 1923-1943</title>, was published in 1944.  Prange joined the US Navy in 1942, taking leave from the University of Maryland, and after completing classes at the Navy School of Military Government at Columbia University, Prange taught courses in Japanese administrative policy for the Navy at Princeton University.  The Pranges' first child, Winfred, was born in 1944.  Following the war in 1946, Prange was assigned to the G-2 Historical Division, General Headquarters, Far East Command in Tokyo, under General Douglas MacArthur, as a civilian historian where he eventually became the division director. The Pranges' second child, Nancy, was born while the family lived in Tokyo.  While in Japan, Prange began his research on the Japanese perspective of the Pearl Harbor attack, conducting interviews with many former Japanese navy and army officers.  He also secured for the University of Maryland, in competition with several other institutions including Stanford University, the records of the Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD) of the Allied Occupation.  This collection was named the <extref href="http://www.lib.umd.edu/prange">Gordon W. Prange Collection</extref> in his honor in 1978.</p>
< <p>By the time Prange returned to the University of Maryland in 1951, a third child, Polly, was born and the family moved into a home in nearby University Park. Prange continued to expand his research, working on three major research projects on the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battle of Midway, and the Russian spy, Richard Sorge.  Book condensations of all three of these projects were published in <title render="italic">Readers Digest</title> in the 1960s and 1970s.  His Japanese-language book, <title render="italic">Tora! Tora! Tora!</title>, was published in 1966 and was later turned into a movie by the Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation, a project for which Prange served as a history advisor.  Prange taught at the University of Maryland until shortly before his death and is still remembered by colleagues and former students as a dynamic teacher who was able to inspire and engage the students in his European History classes.  Prange worked steadily on his Pearl Harbor research during his entire teaching career and had two volumes of what was to be a four-volume work in proofs when he died in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1980.  Following his death, two of Prange's former graduate students, Dr. Donald M. Goldstein and Katherine V. Dillon, worked with McGraw-Hill editors to posthumously publish Prange's manuscripts.</p></bioghist>

As a leading founder of Historic Annapolis, Inc. in 1952 (now Historic Annapolis Foundation), she was the first to advocate for the preservation of an entire historic district instead of a specific historic property or site.  As a result of Wrights activism, downtown Annapolis was designated as a Historic District and a Registered National Landmark by Stewart Udall, secretary of the interior, in 1965.  Under Wrights leadership, Historic Annapolis was able to restore more than 30 buildings of all types, from the mansions of the elite to the homes and businesses of common citizens, throughout the eighteenth-century core of the city.  Her work with Historic Annapolis set important precedents for other preservationists interested in saving streetscapes, towns, and historic communities. </p>

< <scopecontent><p>This series consists of Wrights materials related to the Preservation Keep, a proposed museum intended to document Annapolis history and architecture.  The Keep created much dialogue and debate between Historic Annapolis, the Maryland House and Senate, and citizens of Annapolis in the 1970s and 1980s.  The materials in this series document an early attempt at an Annapolis museum, which finally came to fruition in 2004 with the opening of History Quest.  The series includes drawings of the proposed museum space; grants written to support the Keep; legal documentation including a 1986 City Council Resolution to support the establishment of the Keep; administrative files; memos and correspondence by and to members of the committee to establish the Keep, including Wright; minutes and agendas from meetings held to discuss the Keep; writings by Wright and other people involved in the Keep; and Wrights notes about ideas for the establishment of the museum.  A large portion of the materials are reports from the 1980s on the progress of the establishment of the Keep.</p></scopecontent>

< <scopecontent><p>This series consists of materials related to Archaeology of Annapolis, an idea of Wrights that was operated by Anne Yentsch and Mark Leone during the 1980s and 1990s.  Wright worked closely with Yentsch and Leone on specific preservation projects that required archeological excavations, particularly at Calvert Site.  Many of the materials are reports about archeological findings and artifacts that Historic Annapolis used to prove the historical worth of certain sites.  Memos and correspondence to and from Yentsch and Leone are prominent in this series.

Wright worked closely with Yentsch and Leone on specific preservation projects that required archeological excavations, particularly at Calvert Site.  Many of the materials are reports about archeological findings and artifacts that Historic Annapolis used to prove the historical worth of certain sites.  Memos and correspondence to and from Yentsch and Leone are prominent in this series.  The majority of items have been loosely grouped by date, although memos and correspondence and writings have been put into separate folders.</p></scopecontent>

< After exhausting their formal options to challenge DNR's plans for NPSP, the CPBM changed its name to the Friends of North Point State Park.

Lynch contacted state officials, environmental scientists, and leaders of other non-profit environmental groups.  He assisted other CPBM officers in organizing informational meetings for members and the public.  The officers gathered information on the DNR's activities and plans, and they created alternative plans for the park that would have less impact on the marsh.  CPBM members wrote reports, position papers, and letters to the editors of local newspapers about the importance of the marsh's ecosystem.  </p><p>In a letter to the editor printed in the Baltimore Sun on March 13, 1991, Lynch articulated the aims of the Coalition.  He explained, "In proposing the extension of natural-area protection to the 250-acre Shallow Creek peninsula, the coalition is looking toward the future.  If the peninsula is allowed to fully restore itself through reforestation, the natural area of the park would become a nearly ¾-mile-wide band of forest and marsh protected by four miles of water boundaries."  This improved protection, Lynch and CPBM members believed, would ensure opportunities at Black Marsh "for people to enjoy wildlife, unspoiled natural scenery, archaeological sites, and the rich historical background of the area."  </p><p>Lynch's leadership role in the Black Marsh campaign was part of his larger involvement as a Maryland environmental activist.  He participated in several other preservation struggles as a member and supporter.   Lynch contributed his time and attention to efforts to save Chapman's Landing, Brookview Farm, Oregon Ridge, Cromwell Valley, and other natural areas of central Maryland.</p></bioghist>

Most of the photographs depict houses, buildings, and streets in Baltimore City, some of which may no longer be in existence. Photographs of advertisements for products and places of business from the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries figure prominently in the business enterprises series. The May Oil Burner Corporation figures prominently into this collection, with photographs of advertisements, storefronts, factories, and products found throughout. The collection includes a few photographs of local, state, and national politicians, and prominent citizens, including Mamie Eisenhower with the vice president of B&amp;O Railroad, John Joseph Pershing at the Red Cross Building, and Harry H. Hughes. The collection also contains photographs of some of the oldest houses and estates in Maryland, including the Chase-Lloyd House and White Hall in Annapolis, the Cumberland Toll House, Judge Gabriel Duvall's house Marietta, and a house built by American Revolutionary War patriot Colonel Zadok Magruder. Some of the subjects of the photographs are identified only by their first and last names--in some cases only the last--and no other information is available.</p></bioghist>

< <abstract type="politics">Helen L. Koss (1922-2008) represented Montgomery County in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1971 until her retirement in 1987. She was the first woman appointed to chair a standing committee: the Constitutional and Administrative Law Committee (1979-1987). She sponsored legislation which recognized divorced homemakers as entitled to equal compensation as their former husbands. Additionally, Koss was a proponent of reform in the insurance and housing industries, and sought more equal pay between male and female faculty members. Among the legislation that Koss sponsored during her time in office is the Displaced Homemaker's Bill, which established the first multipurpose center to counsel and train homemakers who experience a loss of income due to divorce, disability, or the death of a spouse. Delegate Koss was inducted into the Maryland Womens Hall of Fame in 1997 for her work promoting gender equality. Major subject areas include womens rights, election laws, and the Displaced Homemakers Bill. The collection is primarily comprised of correspondence, bills and research material, including official committee reports.</abstract>

In addition to his work at the university, Gardner was also deeply involved in numerous agricultural policy initiatives, both domestically and internationally. Gardnerâs papers detail his career as a university professor, policy advisor, and active contributor to the scholarly dialogue of his field. His papers include research and lecture notes, syllabi, exam outlines, correspondence, drafts of books and articles, reports, and presentations. Much of his academic work assesses numerous pieces of legislation which shaped domestic agricultural policy during his lifetime.</abstract>

As fortune would have it, he made his professional debut playing the solo part in his own Piano Concerto No. 1 in F minor (1928) with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Ossip Gabilowitsch at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia and, later, Carnegie Hall in New York. He also played his second Piano Concerto, in F sharp minor, dating from 1931, with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. He attained an international reputation in his early 20s as a protégé of Josef Hofmann. Subsequently he became the first American composer of the younger generation to be performed by Arturo Toscanini; the great maestro chose his "Parade" and "Flirtation in a Chinese Garden" for a concert with the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Chasins retired from the concert stage in 1946 to devote himself entirely to the musical directorship of radio station WQXR, the radio network of The New York Times with which he had been affiliated since 1943. His tenure established a nation-wide standard for classical music programming which has never been surpassed.</p>

< According to former WLW engineer Bill Alberts, they made two field recording trips. The first was conducted from October to December of 1938, and occurred between Cincinnati and eastern Maine. The second was conducted between January and March in 1939, which took them from southern Ohio all the way to Pensacola, FL. In March, 1939, however, the FCC made their final decision to cut WLW's transmitter power back to 50,000 watts. Therefore, the field recordings were not needed, although the engineers had discovered that WOR's transmissions actually interfered with those of WLW, but no final report was ever written on the project. These discs document the state of radio technology and widespread broadcasting practices in the eastern United States in the late 1930s. For more information on the project, see the Dooley Document File for Bill Alberts's 1939 field notes (Folder #8) and a transcription of the interview Laura Schnitker conducted with Bill Alberts in Leesburg, VA, on February 21, 2006 (Folder #9). </p>

< <p>Born in Brooklyn, New York on June 6, 1906, Kirby was the son of a coal merchant.  Sent off to a boarding school at a young age, he returned to New York for a time in his high school years before going to a private military academy in upstate New York.  He was later accepted at the Virginia Military Institute, where he received his A.B. degree in 1926, along with a commission as a 2nd Lt. (Field Artillery) in the U.S. Army Reserves. </p>

< <p>Kirby worked at several jobs over the next few years.  He was a reporter for the <title render="italic">Baltimore Sun</title> and later did economic, statistical and market analysis for several banks.  He worked for C.P.

< <p>Soon, he came to the attention of Edwin Craig, Vice President of the National Life and Accident Insurance Co. of Nashville and a director of the National Association of Broadcasters.  He brought Kirby onboard in 1933, and in a few years the company had increased its insurance in force by 57&#37;, due largely to Kirby's judicious use of the firms' radio station, WSM, as a sales tool.  It was during this period that Kirby met Marjorie Arnold, daughter of the Dean of the Vanderbilt Law School and a staff actress at WSM.  They married in 1936, and had two daughters, Patricia and Kip. </p>

< <p>Towards the end of his tenure with National Life and WSM, Kirby gained valuable experience in working under duress during the disastrous spring floods of 1937. He also had an idea for a monthly magazine, called <title render="italic">Rural Radio</title>, which was created solely for rural listeners.  It took almost a year to get off the ground and initially was a great success.  But it folded soon since Kirby accepted an offer to become the National Association of Broadcasters' first full-time Director of Public Relations in Washington, D.C.  While with the NAB, Kirby served as the Secretary of the NAB Code Committee and helped setup what later came to be known as the Broadcast Advertising Bureau. He also worked behind the scenes to help free broadcasting from the grip of ASCAP through the creation of Broadcast Music, Inc. </p>

< <p>In December of 1940, Kirby was loaned to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson as a "dollar a year" civilian advisor for radio,  becoming as such as the defacto head of the Army's radio branch.  He also served as a liaison between the broadcast community and the War Department.  One of his most important jobs in that capacity was to lobby for the continued independence of radio in the face of the increasing inevitability of U.S. entry into World War II.  In this he was successful, as there was no outright takeover of broadcasting facilities by the government in the wake of the attack on Pearl Harbor. </p>

< <p>Soon after the attack, work began under Kirby's direction on two radio programs, <title render="italic">The Army Hour</title>, meant for listeners on the homefront, and <title render="italic">Command Performance</title>, for those in uniform.  <title render="italic">The Army Hour</title> was an attempt to bring the reality of the war home to the American people through the power and immediacy of radio.  It was carried by NBC, which spent hundreds of thousands of dollars annually on the show.

< <p><title render="italic">Command Performance</title> was the brainchild of Lou Cowan, who was asked by Kirby to come up with a show to entertain the troops overseas.  The idea Cowan came back with was a natural for an army of "citizen soldiers" fighting for democracy far from home.  As Kirby later wrote: "The GI who was trained to obey commands in the line of duty could now command anything he wanted from the radio world in the way of entertainmentIt was unique, it was democratic, it was American."  It also made for perhaps the best program of the war years, though one that civilians hardly ever got to hear. </p>

< <p>In May of 1942 Kirby became Lt. Colonel Kirby, with substantially the same duties he had as a civilian.  In 1944 he was attached to General Eisenhower's staff to carry out perhaps the most important broadcasting-related assignment of the war.  Kirby was given the task of coordinating all radio coverage of D-Day and the subsequent invasion, as well as establishing an allied radio network to serve all the troops involved in the operation.  For his efforts he was promoted to full Colonel, and was awarded the Legion of Merit and the Order of the British Empire.  In 1943 he was honored with a Peabody Radio Award for "Yankee Ingenuity on a global scale." </p>

< <p>Kirby was also instrumental in persuading Universal Pictures to do a film about famous bandleader Glenn Miller, who lost his life while on a plane trip to entertain American troops during World War II.  Kirby had worked closely with Miller in arranging his schedules and camp shows during his military career.  During the filming of the production, Colonel Kirby served as one of the technical advisers. The movie, <title render="italic">The Glenn Miller Story</title> came out in 1954. </p>

< <p>Colonel Kirby left the Army for the last time in March of 1953.  Working for the Washington D.C.

In fact I must admit that it wasn't until about a year later that I began to feel at all comfortable with her.  The reason for this was that in spite of her being so consistently nice to me I was embarrassed by her appearance, which seemed to have been artificially imposed on the rest of her personality.  She had immense dignity and distinction, and could also be charmingly gay and unaffected; she drew me out sympathetically and made me feel that my ideas and emotions were intensely interesting and important to her.

In 1968, Flint joined the Georgetown University (Washington, DC) faculty where he taught English literature and creative writing until his retirement in 1997.  During his career, Flint authored six collections of poetry, contributed poems to numerous national periodicals including the <title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title> and served as poet laureate of Maryland from 1995 until 2000.

< After studying illustration in Chicago under Frederic Goudy he moved to Hingham, Massachusetts in the first years of the century to work with Goudy and his Village Press, where he lived the rest of his life. Most of his work in the first two decades was in the advertising field which made use of his skills as a calligrapher and graphic artist. It was not until the mid-twenties that Dwiggins emerged as a book designer, following the publication of his 1919 essay "Extracts from an Investigation into the Physical Properties of Books as They Are At Present Published", written with his cousin Laurance B. Siegfried who later became editor of <title render="italic">The American Printer</title>. Published by The Society of Calligraphers, a fictitious group, with the "help" of Hermann Püterschein, Dwiggins' alter-ego, the essay did shake up a few men in the publishing industry by criticizing the lack of attention to careful design and typography and helped to establish Dwiggins as a designer opposed to shoddy workmanship.</p>

Published by The Society of Calligraphers, a fictitious group, with the "help" of Hermann PÃ¼terschein, Dwiggins' alter-ego, the essay did shake up a few men in the publishing industry by criticizing the lack of attention to careful design and typography and helped to establish Dwiggins as a designer opposed to shoddy workmanship.</p>

< <abstract label="Short Description of Collection" encodinganalog="520$a">The French Pamphlet Collection contains approximately 12,000 pieces dating from 1620 to 1966, covering many key episodes in the history of France. The largest part of the collection is made up of 7000 pamphlets from the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, 1788-1815. These include government publications from the first ten years of the French Revolution, 1790-1799; over 1700 decrees and laws published from 1789 to 1795; and sixty-four Revolutionary journals in a series by Jacques-Rene Hebert of Pére Duchesne fame. Beginning with the call by Louis XVI for a national discussion of the agenda of the Estates General in 1788, pamphlets became a major form of expression during a period of uninhibited debate in France. Pamphlets and other printed ephemera also became more common on the eve of the Revolution when the old system of royal regulation of printing and book selling collapsed.  In addition to the Revolutionary era, major strengths in the collection include pamphlets produced during the Fronde (1649-1652), as well as 19th century French plays. Oversize posters and broadsides from the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries can be found in the collection as well. Some of these materials also chronicle France's involvement with the Middle East, centering on the conflict with the Ottoman Empire, 1900-1924.</abstract>

< <p>Benny Goodman (19091986), the American clarinetist and bandmaster, was an influential musician during the twentieth century. Known also as "The King of Swing," Benny Goodman was born into a poor family of immigrants in Chicago. He began his performing career early, establishing himself as a leading performer and session musician by his late teens. He neglected his education to work full time as a musician. Goodman performed at notable venues such as Carnegie Hall  the first time jazz had ever been performed there. He is credited as helping to bring jazz and swing, formerly seen as an underground art form, to the mainstream American public.</p>

< <abstract label="Short Description of Collection" encodinganalog="520$a">Convened in October of 1964, The Congress on Research in Dance is an international community of dance researchers, scholars, teachers, and performers who seek to encourage, facilitate and disseminate dance scholarship. The organization promotes a discursive approach to researching and understanding dance as more than just art and expression, but the value of the form as a manifestation of universal communication, resonant ideas, and cultural commodity. The Congress on Research in Dance collection covers the period from 1964 to 1999; the bulk of the materials date from 1975 to 1999. The collection consists of founding documents, bylaws, Board and member correspondence, meeting minutes, published volumes of CORDs own Dance Research Journal, an assortment of specially published CORD issues devoted to specific topics, conference materials, scholarly papers submitted to the conferences, newsletters, office materials, and financial documents.</abstract>

< <abstract label="Short Description of Collection" encodinganalog="520$a">Colonel George Sallade Howard (1902-1995) was known for his significant contributions to the Air Force Band Program. Director of the USAF Band program from 1944-1963, Colonel Howard took the USAF Band and Orchestra on ten international tours, promoting music as an international language. He founded several military music groups, including the Singing Sergeants, the Airmen of Note, the USAF Drum and Bugle Corp, the USAF Bagpipe Band, the WAF Band, and the Strolling Strings. In addition to Howards military accomplishments, he was a successful music educator, earning multiple degrees in music performance and education. Howard also served as a clinician and spokesperson for bands and band music throughout his life. A past president of the National Bandmasters Association and Chair of the John Phillip Sousa Memorial, Howard worked alongside and was closely acquainted with other prominent band directors and composers of the era, such as Patrick Conway, Ernest Williams, Percy Grainger, and Edwin and Richard Franko Goldman. The Colonel George S. Howard Papers covers the period from 1920 to 1994; the bulk of the materials date from 1935 to 1965. The collection consists of both personal and professional papers including published and unpublished writings, correspondence, addresses, programs, reports, memorabilia, clippings, and articles- related to Howards work as a band director of the United States Air Force Band, including his work with Ernest Williams and the Williams School of Music and Summer Camp, with Pat Conway as a student and member of Conways professional band, a teacher at Mansfield State Teachers College, Penn State, and the Mooseheart School (IL), and as a leading clinician for bands throughout his career.</abstract>

> <abstract type="musclass">The Society for Music Theory (SMT) promotes music theory as both a scholarly and a pedagogical discipline. SMT has a membership of over 1200 music theorists worldwide. SMT was founded in 1977 out of the American Musicological Society by Richmond Browne, Allen Forte, and others who believed that Music Theory was not adequately respected as a subject and should be taught by theorists instead of musicologists, performers, or composers. The first SMT meeting was held in Evanston in 1977. The Society has held an Annual Meeting hosted by a different University every year at which members present analytical and pedagogical research. The SMT publishes a twice-annual journal, The Music Theory Spectrum, and a Newsletter. This collection contains personal papers from past Presidents, Secretaries and Treasurers, papers from the Executive Board meetings, By-laws and business office papers, membership materials, Newsletters and Music Theory Spectrum along with Editorsâ Papers, Committee correspondence and reports, correspondence with other related organizations, and papers and ephemera from Annual Meetings.</abstract>

Two of his most well known works include his <title render="italic">Cello Concerto</title> (1990), and his symphony <title render="italic">RiverRun</title> (1993-94). His <title render="italic">Cello Concerto</title>, written for Yo-Yo Ma, received a Grammy Award, while <title render="italic">RiverRun</title> received a Pulitzer Prize in 1985.

< The collections broad scope provides insight into music education and social mindsets of the United States over the past century. Studying the resources available to teachers can reveal the employment of different educational methods over time; in addition, study of the types of songs and song collections being published and sold to the public can reveal the societal traits of a population from a particular time period. The collection holds value for a researcher interested in both music education and the general American public of the 19th and 20th centuries.</abstract>

< <abstract label="Short Description of Collection" encodinganalog="520$a">Joseph Schuster (1905-1969) was a cellist, conductor, and arranger of cello music. Schuster was born in Constantinople (Istanbul), Turkey, to a Russian family and began proper cello studies at the Moscow Conservatory until the Russian Revolution prompted his family to flee to Berlin, Germany, where he studied at the Berlin Hochschule with Hugo Becker. Schuster went on to become the solo cellist in the Berlin Philharmonic until he moved to New York in 1934. While in New York he held the position of Principal Cellist with the New York Philharmonic under Bruno Walter.  Schuster was soloist in Don Quixote with the New York Philharmonic for Leonard Bernsteins NYP debut. During his final year with the Philarmonic Leonard Rose was his Assistant Principal. The Joseph Schuster Cello Scores Collection contains the score collection of Joseph Schuster.  This collection, which consists of 211 scores, includes rare pieces, arrangements by Schuster, original works autographed to Schuster by the composers, and works with thorough markings and edits by Schuster; the collection also includes correspondence between Schuster and composers and publishers.</abstract>

< <abstract type="MUS">The Silver Spring Nursery School was a cooperative nursery school in Silver Spring, Maryland started in 1941 by a group of mothers active in the Montgomery County League of Women Voters who expanded their children's play group into a nursery school. Ruth Crawford-Seeger, notable both as a composer and collector of American folksong, became affiliated with the school in 1941 when her daughter was a student. As part of her parental cooperative duties for the school, she taught music for that academic year, but returned to the school periodically in the 1940s. The collection contains materials created between 1975 and 1976. The interviews conducted for the Project start with the era of Crawford-Seegers ancestors in 1854 and continue into 1975 when the interviews were conducted. The interviews are with four of the mothers from the school, and notable folk musician Mike Seeger, Crawford-Seegers son. The collection consists of oral history transcripts, audio recordings, and a subsequent draft of the graduate seminar paper composed by Betty Claire Scott based on the oral histories she collected.</abstract>

< <p>The service was first established by students in November 1972 as a nighttime security service, in response to concerns about student safety.  The Student Government Association purchased the initial two vans, and operating costs were provided by the administration, through the Office of Commuter Student Affairs. In the spring, the Resident Housing Association and the University Commuters Association each donated an additional van, and the number of routes was increased to three. During the following school year, daytime intracampus routes to the parking lots and an evening Call-A-Ride (now known as NITE Ride) were added. In the summer of 1975, four Mercedes mini-buses were purchased, and Shuttle-UM name was established. Charter operations were initiated in fall of 1975, followed by off-campus commuter routes in spring of 1976. Disabled transit service (renamed Paratransit during the 1989-1990 school year) began the following fall. </p>

< <p>Some interesting facts about the history of chapel: Henry Powel Hopkins was the architect for the chapel, and he also designed and made a complete silver communion set to be used in its services. The first funeral recorded was for UMCP Registrar Alma Prienkart, whose un-solved murder in 1954 was a shock to the community.  In the wedding registers that were kept by the chapel, the first wedding to be listed was for Albert E. Statt and Helen Ann Bump on November 27, 1952. Additionally, there have been generous gifts made to the chapel. They include the Mollër Organ housed in the Main Chapel, the Carillonic Bells, the Memorial Garden, the above mentioned Communion Silver Set, some Brass Alter Pieces, an Embroidered Altar Cloth, and the Blessed Sacrament Chapel. This last item was built largely from the funds of a Mr. Thomas Pangborn of Hagerstown, MD who was a long time friend of the University.</p></bioghist>
